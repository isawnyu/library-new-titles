library-new-titles
==================

Code for taking a list of NYU-Bobst BNR numbers and getting back a batch of corresponding MARC21 records from the library's Aleph server that can then be uploaded to Zotero.

This is in support of an effort to create a monthly "new titles" listing for the ISAW library.
