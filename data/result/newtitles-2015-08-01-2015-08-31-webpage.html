      <h1>New Titles: August 1, 2015 - August 31, 2015</h1>
      <p>The following books were acquired and accessioned by the <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/library/">ISAW Library</a> between August 1, 2015 and August 31, 2015. Items are sorted alphabetically by title.
         
         This information is <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/isaw_library_new_titles/items/collectionKey/JCK37K54">available in a Zotero library</a>.
         
      </p>
      <p>We build a single Zotero library for the entire academic year, with each month representing
         a Zotero collection. One may therefore view or search just that collection or the
         entire library. Note that the tags are drawn from pre-existing metadata (i.e., the
         ISAW Library staff does not tag entries) and represents the contents of the entire
         library. That is, you will see tags for all works in the Zotero library, but not necessarily
         associated with anything accessioned in the particular monthly collection you are
         viewing. For example, if you review acquisitions for January 2015 and select a tag
         for "Hittite," nothing may come up. This means that nothing accessioned in January
         2015 was tagged as "Hittite." However, it does mean that something that academic year
         was tagged as "Hittite." So, if you move up the hierarchy from the collection "January
         2015" to library for the 2014-2015 academic year and then click on "Hittite," you
         will find items so tagged from previous months, e.g., October 2014. <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Click here for information about Zotero</a>.
